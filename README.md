## PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.
### Please note that instructions may vary depending on version/circumstances. This section will also cover Git & GitHub setup as well.

1) Download the latest version of **Git** from [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   - Note: For Windows, as of writing this, the latest release is version 2.35.1.
   - There are instructions on installing **Git** for Mac and Linux on the downloads page. Also, if you for some reason need an older version of **Git** (possibly due to corruption or something ¯&#92;&#95;(ツ)_/¯ ), they are available on both the [website](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/) and the **Git** source **repository** on [GitHub](https://github.com/git/git).
2) Find and install the downloaded **Git** file (with most, if not, all default settings). 
3) Go through the process of registering as a student account on the JetBrains website to get access to the student licensed WebStorm.
4) Download the latest version of [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). You may also want to try downloading it through the [student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) section.
5) Find and install the downloaded Webstorm file (with most, if not, all default settings).
6) Now, it's time to set-up **GitHub** while both **Git** and Webstorm are installing.
   1) Go to **GitHub**'s website ([github.com](https://github.com)) and register for an account.
   2) Once setup, congrats! You now have a **GitHub** account!
